# Elixir Cloud & AAI

## Introduction

Official webpage for the ELIXIR Cloud & AAI project.

ELIXIR Cloud & AAI develops services towards establishing a federated [cloud
computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) network that enables
the analysis of population-scale genomic and phenotypic data across
participating, international nodes.

## About

This website is built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework for
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/). Most of the pages on the website are built
statically during build time for fast client-side rendering and better SEO.

Content for the website is fetched from
[Notion](https://developers.notion.com/), where it can be conveniently edited
by authorized users. If you are a member of ELIXIR Cloud & AAI and would like
to contribute, please contact the [administrator](https://github.com/uniqueg).

## Setup

Any contributor is welcome to contribute to the website.

To set up the development environment, follow the steps:

- Fork & clone this repository on your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- For API/backed part create the [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) account.
- Open the [Elixir Cloud & AAI](https://www.notion.so/Elixir-Cloud-AAI-cdb71fe2334c4e83b920219b2c3b9794) notion page & duplicate it to your account.
- Create the [Notion developers](https://developers.notion.com/) account with the same email. [Create a new integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs#step-1-create-an-integration) in your account & store the Internal Integration Token. [Link the integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs#step-2-share-a-database-with-your-integration) to the duplicated page in your account.
- Create a new file in the root directory with the name `.env.local` & add your Internal Integration Token as Notion Token:

```bash
NOTION_TOKEN=<YOUR-NOTION-TOKEN>
```

- Start the local development server by:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed:

* Docker (19.03.8, build afacb8b7f0)
* docker-compose (1.23.1, build b02f1306)
* Git (2.25.1)

> These are the versions used for development/testing. Other versions may or
> may not work. Please let us know if you encounter any issues with _newer_
> versions than the ones listed.

### Deploying the website

To deploy the app, first set the Notion token:

```bash
NOTION_TOKEN=<YOUR-NOTION-TOKEN>
```

Then build and deploy the app image with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The website should now be available at `http://localhost` (port 80).

Of course, these deployment instructions are only a starting point. You may
want to adapt the them to your individual needs.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** **Never** publish the built container image! It will be
> easy to access your Notion token.

### Taking down the website

To stop the server, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Versioning

The project adopts the semantic versioning scheme for versioning. Currently the
site is in beta stage, so content will change frequently.
