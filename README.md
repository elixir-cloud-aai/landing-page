# Elixir Cloud & AAI

## Introduction

Official webpage for the ELIXIR Cloud & AAI project.

ELIXIR Cloud & AAI develops services towards establishing a federated [cloud
computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) network that enables
the analysis of population-scale genomic and phenotypic data across
participating, international nodes.

## About

This website is built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework for
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/). Most of the pages on the website are built
statically during build time for fast client-side rendering and better SEO.

Content for the website is fetched from
[Notion](https://developers.notion.com/), where it can be conveniently edited
by authorized users. If you are a member of ELIXIR Cloud & AAI and would like
to contribute, please contact the [administrator](https://github.com/uniqueg).

## Setup

Any contributor is welcome to contribute to the website.

To set up the development environment, follow the steps:

- Fork & clone this repository on your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- For API/backed part create the [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) account.
- Open the [Elixir Cloud & AAI](https://www.notion.so/Elixir-Cloud-AAI-cdb71fe2334c4e83b920219b2c3b9794) notion page & duplicate it to your account.
- Create the [Notion developers](https://developers.notion.com/) account with the same email. [Create a new integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs#step-1-create-an-integration) in your account & store the Internal Integration Token. [Link the integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs#step-2-share-a-database-with-your-integration) to the duplicated page in your account.
- Create a new file in the root directory with the name `.env.local` & add your Internal Integration Token as Notion Token:

```bash
NOTION_TOKEN=<YOUR-NOTION-TOKEN>
```

- Start the local development server by:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

To deploy the app, first set the Notion token:

```bash
NOTION_TOKEN=<YOUR-NOTION-TOKEN>
```

Then build the app image with the following command:

```bash
docker build . --build-arg NOTION_SECRET=${NOTION_TOKEN} -t elixircloud/landing-page:current
```

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Do **not** publish the built container image. It will be
> easy to access your Notion token.

Then start the service with:

```bash
docker run exlicircloud/landing-page:current
```

### Via `docker-compose`

The above instructions are fine for quickly checking out how to deploy the app.
However, for more stable deployments we strongly recommend that you use
`docker-compose` to deploy the app.

Place the in file `docker-compose.yaml` inside the project root:

```bash
  landing-page:
    image: elixircloud/landing-page:current
    container_name: landing-page
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:
        NOTION_SECRET: $NOTION_TOKEN
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - 3000
```

> Note that this is only a starting point. You may want to adapt it to your
> particular needs.

Then deploy the service with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

> To take down the deployment, simply do `docker-compose down`
